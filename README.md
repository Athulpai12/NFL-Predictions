# NFL-Predictions
NFL is one of the most followed game having millions of followers all around the world.The current work involves the prediction of NFL match results by using a custom model incorporating a deep neural network and ticket prices for the match using regression modelling. This work considers the most important factor in NFL, the momentum. The prediction model has the capability to get better accuracy than previous models reported. All predictions are made for Week 17 by learning from Week 1 –16’s data.
# Project Title -
 NFL PREDICTION
 Our project deals with predicting the outcome of week 17 in a regular season.We are also predict the ticket prices of each game

## Getting Started

To setup the project run the code on  r-studio

### Prerequisites

The compier version under which the project is executed - 3.4.2
The r-studio version - R-studio - 1.1.383
THe following libraries are required to run our project on another local machine

library(neuralnet)
library(ggpubr)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(MASS)
library(caret)

also the local machine has to be equiped with R- code compiler
### Installing

To install each of the of the library 
run 
install.packages("package-name")

R compiler link
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

R studio IDE link
https://www.rstudio.com/

## Running the tests

In the compile the code and click on run . The output will automatically be displayed on the screen

### What does the test indicate

The following test tells how  accurate is the model in being able to predict the win and loss of a game.

### And coding style 

The following code was build under windows platform and uses the windows style of coding 

## Deployment

No further deployment is required
